# LED Blinking Game

This project demonstrates how to create an interactive LED blinking game using Rust on BeagleBone. The game involves LEDs blinking in a sequence, and the user must press the corresponding button to turn off the LED and advance to the next one.

## Hardware Requirements
1. BeagleBone or a similar development board
2. 3 LEDs (red, blue, yellow)
3. 3 Resistors (220Ω each)
4. 3 Momentary push-button switches
5. 3 Resistors (10kΩ each)
6. Breadboard and jumper wires
